<h1>digit-recognization</h1>
<h3>There are 3 main steps involved in building this project</br></h3>
1)creating a model using CNN's and frameworks like keras,tensorflow.</br>
2)drawing the Bounding boxes in the image using opencv image processing like threshold and contours etc</br>
3)Deployment using streamlit library</br>


## Local Installation</br>

1. Drop a ‚≠ê on the Github Repository. 
2. Clone the Repo by going to your local Git Client and pushing in the command: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sivasai9398/digit-recognization.git
```

3. Install the Packages: 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. At last, push in the command:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

5. Now the streamlit application will be opened in the browser and u can enjoy the application
